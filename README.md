# Portfolio

## Preface

This website was originally generated using Create React App. I eventually hit a performance bottleneck and ported the website over to React Static. You may choose to run the site differently, but I have found that `yarn start` for development and `yarn build` followed by `serve dist -p <port>` for production work well for me. `yarn build --staging` can also be used to test a production build on localhost.
